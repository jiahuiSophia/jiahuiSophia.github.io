Abstract: With the rise of short videos, social media platforms have expanded into various societal groups, becoming pivotal platforms for information dissemination. This research aims to explore the evolution of media platformization and, based on this trajectory, analyze the developmental trends of short-video social media platforms. Furthermore, it seeks to analyze the behavioral characteristics of diverse groups on platformized social media and identify the challenges faced by these groups in participating in platformized governance. Through this analysis, the study aims to propose recommendations for innovative practices in the future development of short-video social media platforms.
