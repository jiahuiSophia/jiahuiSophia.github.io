Wang, X., **Liu, J.** (2021). A Research on the Platform-based Governance of Short Video Social Media: from the Perspective of Social Participation of Diverse Groups. _Southeast Communication,_ 2021(10):40-43. (in Chinese)

Abstract: With the rise of short videos, social media platforms have expanded into various societal groups, becoming pivotal platforms for information dissemination. This research aims to explore the evolution of media platformization and, based on this trajectory, analyze the developmental trends of short-video social media platforms. Furthermore, it seeks to analyze the behavioral characteristics of diverse groups on platformized social media and identify the challenges faced by these groups in participating in platformized governance. Through this analysis, the study aims to propose recommendations for innovative practices in the future development of short-video social media platforms.

1. **Liu, J.**, Ma, C., Wang, R. (under major revision). Amplifying Contention or Promoting Feminism? Topic Construction and Human-Bot Interaction on Twitter around the Overturning of Roe v. Wade. Submitted to _Computers in Human Behavior_.

- Abstract: Social bots are disrupting the authenticity of social discussions by generating human-machine interaction. The aim of the current study was to explore the role of social bots in discourse about a feminist issue on social media. By analyzing a dataset of 780,358 tweets specifically related to U.S. abortion legislation, we discovered active participation of social bots in discussions about the overturning of Roe v. Wade on Twitter in 2022. First, hashtag co-occurrence analysis revealed less diversity in the hashtags used by social bots than those used by humans. In addition, subtheme analysis indicated that social bots intentionally amplified specific subthemes and that discussion about the U.S. abortion laws preferred by social bots were highly associated with partisan election issues, suggesting an inflammatory effect. In terms of stance analysis, we found that social bots posted more tweets opposing abortion rights than humans did, indicating a disruption of the consistency of specific hashtags. Social bots opposing abortion rights were more active in generating interaction among users than in mere tweet dissemination. Finally, by analyzing the interaction between social bots and human accounts, we discovered that social bots used deception to engage humans in conversations and propagate target viewpoints. Based on these findings, we summarize how automation generates human-bot interaction and provide recommendations for shaping public understanding of feminist issues in the era of artificial intelligence.

2. **Liu, J.** (under minor revision). Virtual Presence, Real Connections: Exploring the Role of Parasocial Relationships in Virtual Idol Fan Community Participation. Submitted to _Global Media and China._

- Abstract: The culture of idol worship is undergoing a reconstruction with the development of virtual personas. Nowadays, virtual idols have evolved into AI-powered entities created using digital media technologies such as virtual reality, motion capture, and voice synthesis. These virtual idols lack physical bodies but can fully emulate real idols in their performances and interact with humans. Previous research on the interaction between celebrities and fans has primarily focused on real-life idols, while studies explaining why fans become infatuated with virtual idols despite knowing that there is no physical presence on stage are scarce. This study explores the factors influencing fan community participation in virtual idol fandom, adopting the perspective of parasocial relationships and employing the method of questionnaire survey. The aim is to uncover how virtual parasocial objects facilitate real fan connections. The findings reveal that both interpersonal attractiveness and loneliness have a significant positive impact on parasocial relationships (PSRs) between virtual idols and fans. Additionally, PSRs between virtual idols and fans positively influence fan community participation. Lastly, both the interpersonal attractiveness of virtual idols and the loneliness of fans have a positive impact on fan community participation through the mediating effect of PSRs. This study examines the significant factors that sustain the relationship between virtual idols and fans, particularly in the context where virtual idols are becoming increasingly human-like and skilled in interacting with the audience. The results of this study highlight the characteristics of Chinese fan culture practices and provide evidence for the “de-stigmatization” of youth subcultures in the context of AI technology increasingly permeating everyday life.

3. Dong, S., **Liu, J.**, Yu, M. (under review). Digital Unfriending in _Guanxi_ Society: Influencing Factors of Selective Avoidance of Chinese WeChat Moments Users in Controversial Public Events. Submitted to _China Journalism and Communication Journal._ (in Chinese)

- Abstract: While controversial public events keep triggering general discussion, the diversity of ideological cognition generates different opinions and may affect user friendships and lead to digital break-ups. This behavior of terminating social relationships, such as deleting, blacklisting, and blocking to avoid other people’s content, is defined as selective avoidance on social media platforms, which used to be a sensitive topic in China’s _Guanxi_ society. Previous studies lack exploration in Chinese contexts. Based on the theory of interpersonal needs, we used the mixed method to explore the influencing factors in WeChat Moments. Semi-structured focus group interviews were first conducted, and we proposed a new dimension of social value need. In the questionnaire survey (n = 537, 62.6% female), we found that the social media space is more focused on the “viewpoint” connection compared with traditional society’s “relationship” connection. Affection need and control need positively influence selective avoidance through emotional perception. Emotional perception plays a fully mediating role in online social interaction in the Chinese context. It has become an essential factor in deciding whether to maintain a friendship on social media. This study examines the introduction of selective avoidance theory into the context of China’s Guanxi society and uncovers how information overload has changed the digital interaction norms of the younger generation in China by increasing the costs associated with information acquisition and maintaining social relationships.
