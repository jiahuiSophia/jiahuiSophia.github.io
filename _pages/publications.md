Wang, X., **Liu, J.** (2021). A Research on the Platform-based Governance of Short Video Social Media: from the Perspective of Social Participation of Diverse Groups. _Southeast Communication,_ 2021(10):40-43. (in Chinese)

Abstract: With the rise of short videos, social media platforms have expanded into various societal groups, becoming pivotal platforms for information dissemination. This research aims to explore the evolution of media platformization and, based on this trajectory, analyze the developmental trends of short-video social media platforms. Furthermore, it seeks to analyze the behavioral characteristics of diverse groups on platformized social media and identify the challenges faced by these groups in participating in platformized governance. Through this analysis, the study aims to propose recommendations for innovative practices in the future development of short-video social media platforms.

Abstract: Social bots are disrupting the authenticity of social discussions by generating human-machine interaction. The aim of the current study 
was to explore the role of social bots in discourse about a feminist issue on social media. By analyzing a dataset of 780,358 tweets specifically 
related to U.S. abortion legislation, we discovered active participation of social bots in discussions about the overturning of Roe v. Wade on 
Twitter in 2022. First, hashtag co-occurrence analysis revealed less diversity in the hashtags used by social bots than those used by humans. In 
addition, subtheme analysis indicated that social bots intentionally amplified specific subthemes and that discussion about the U.S. abortion laws 
preferred by social bots were highly associated with partisan election issues, suggesting an inflammatory effect. In terms of stance analysis, we 
found that social bots posted more tweets opposing abortion rights than humans did, indicating a disruption of the consistency of specific 
hashtags. Social bots opposing abortion rights were more active in generating interaction among users than in mere tweet dissemination. Finally, 
by analyzing the interaction between social bots and human accounts, we discovered that social bots used deception to engage humans in 
conversations and propagate target viewpoints. Based on these findings, we summarize how automation generates human-bot interaction and provide 
recommendations for shaping public understanding of feminist issues in the era of artificial intelligence.
