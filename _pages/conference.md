1. **Liu, J.**, Li, D., Chen, J. (2023). How Human Identity Transcends Machines: Techno-Ethics of Generative Artificial Intelligence from the Critical Cybernetics Perspective. Presented at the _2023 Media Culture Forum_, Shanghai, China. (in Chinese)
   - Abstract: What makes us human, and how do we transcend machines? This article explores the importance of human identity in the context of the continuous rise of generative artificial intelligence. The article first introduces the historical evolution of human-machine language interaction technology and the technical composition of this revolutionary language interaction model, ChatGPT. Secondly, from a critical perspective on cybernetics, the article posits that the unique identity inherent in humans is the key to what defines us as humans. This identity encompasses consciousness and subjective experiences, emotional perception and resonance, morality and ethics, self-shaping, and development. The article also discusses the technological limitations of generative artificial intelligence and calls for a rational approach to the future of human-machine symbiosis.

6. Wu, J., **Liu, J.** (2021). We Pay, We Share: Influencing Factors of Digital Knowledge Sharing Behaviors in Chinese Knowledge-paid Communities. Presented at the _2021 Annual Conference of Asian Network for Public Opinion Research and the Asia-Pacific Communication Alliance_, online.

   - Abstract: [Purpose/Meaning] With the development of Internet technology, knowledge-paid communities begin to emerge in China, building new knowledge systems online. Analyzing influencing factors of digital sharing behaviors can help us understand the relationships aggregated by paying for knowledge and why people still show a sharing willingness after paying. [Method/Process] Based on the theory of knowledge ecology and planned behavior, this research re-examines the influencing factors of knowledge sharing behaviors in online pre-paid communities from four dimensions of knowledge, knowledge subjects, information technology and knowledge environment, and constructs a model to measure them. It uses methods of questionnaire survey and structural equation modeling, and software SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 21.0 are also used to perform statistical analysis. [Results/Conclusions] The results show that three factors of knowledge, information technology and knowledge environment all have positive influences on sharing behaviors through the members’ willingness to share the knowledge. Among them, knowledge environment has the greatest influence, which means the three types of factors in communication environment--opinion environment, interaction atmosphere and mutual assistance are getting important in the decisive process of whether to share the knowledge in communities. Those factors depend on the members’ perception and understanding of cohesion inside communities. [Originality] This research confirms the originality of contents and questionnaire data obtained. It puts forward a model for the construction of social environment factors from the perspective of knowledge ecology based on the development of online knowledge communities in China, trying to provide references for researches in other regions around the world.
