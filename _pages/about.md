Hi there! I am currently a second-year Master's student majoring in Communication at the Communication University of China [CUC pages](https://en.cuc.edu.cn/). I am actively applying for Ph.D. programs and seeking research assistant positions. My research interests revolve around AI-mediated communication, VR and avatars, and media psychology. During my Ph.D., I aim to explore the psychological mechanisms and social impacts of deception in Avatar-Mediated Communication (AMC). This will encompass three main research themes: understanding how individuals perceive deception in AMC, identifying factors that influence detecting deception in AMC, and developing strategies to debunk and counter deception in AMC.

As a devoted fan of the Transformers science fiction series for ten years, I have always been fascinated by the interactions between humans and machine intelligence, and am keen to bridge my avocation with academic exploration.
