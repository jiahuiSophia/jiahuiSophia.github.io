Hi there! I am a second-year Master's student majoring in Communication at the [Communication University of China](https://en.cuc.edu.cn/). I am actively applying for Ph.D. programs and seeking research assistant positions. 

My research interests revolve around **AI-mediated communication**, **VR and avatars**, and **media psychology**. During my Ph.D., I aim to explore the psychological mechanisms and social impacts of **deception in Avatar-Mediated Communication** (AMC). This will encompass three main research themes: understanding how individuals perceive deception in AMC, identifying factors that influence detecting deception in AMC, and developing strategies to debunk and counter deception in AMC.

Currently, I am collaborating with [Professor Rui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JTCpAtYAAAAJ) on a research paper exploring the impact of social bots on Twitter discussions regarding U.S. abortion legislation. Additionally, I am a member of Professor Jingxi Chen's Intelligent Media and Health Communication research group, where we are in the process of designing an Interactive WeChat Mini-program aimed at providing experiential pregnancy knowledge.

I am honored to be selected as one of the few worldwide recipients of the $1,250 **Hailey Travel Grant** for the 73rd Annual Conference of the ICA. It was there that I had the fortune to meet [Professor Robby](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/rabindra-ratan) and many other researchers and doctoral students, who provided invaluable assistance in my Ph.D. application process.

As a devoted fan of the **Transformers** science fiction series for ten years, I have always been fascinated by the interactions between humans and machine intelligence, and am keen to bridge my avocation with academic exploration.
